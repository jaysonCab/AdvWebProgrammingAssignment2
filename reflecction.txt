I completd this assignment after beginning the project 1, milestone 2 MVC setup using mustache to display variable front ends without having to refresh the page.
This assignment, however, encorperated a different strategy. On commit 7c8c1a9c6ad58393ce7365df8a9e2d00b1a962d8, I created an ampty div variable within the HTML
page and through script.js, manipulated the DOM to display exact front end HTML commands. Since the front end displays parts of the DOM that were updated, by
replacing this blank container of sorts with precise HTML commands you are able to dynamically change the front end, in this case I utilized an API call to populate
an HTML template and push this template to update the DOM. 

There was one simple experimentation I conducted that served as a quality of life change that I believe had a great impact which was while this asynchronous call
of the API was being conducted, there could be a long wait time before the button is clicked and the information would show up. On commit 
56952b0aca41b3a11bcd6c2f16f202d2b15e7eff, the sequence of events that occur immidiately when the button is pressed to submit is to edit this placeholder div
with the text to display, 'Currently loading please wait'. Once the API data is fetched through the endpoint, that is when I re-update that same div element
with the proper information. This optional quality of life change helps the user know the application is working as expected rather than being left with a blank
screen while things are loading, causing the user to second guess if it's working or not.
